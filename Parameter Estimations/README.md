# Parameter Estimation

Parameter estimation of a given system was performed with

-	Recursive Least Squares
-	Recursive Least Squares with forgetting factor
-	Extended Least Squares
-	Least Means Square
-	Projection Algorithm
-	Stochastic Approximation Algorithm

For the second part, an identification with RLS and ELS was performed to a system with feedback. The results can be seen in odev4.pdf file.
