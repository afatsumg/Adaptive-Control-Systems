# Second order system with MIT Rule

A second order system model reference adaptive control system simulink model was created. 

u = K(uc-y) proportional control was used as the control law.

The system response was investigated under different square wave amplitudes. As a result, it can be easily seen that MRAS does not guarantee the stability of the system.
